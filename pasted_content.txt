🔹 4. 📷 Screenshot Upload & Chart Analyzer

User uploads image (e.g., screenshot from TradingView)

Run image through:

OCR: Tesseract.js or EasyOCR (open source)

AI pattern detection: YOLOv5, Detectron2, or OpenCV


Match extracted values with Binance data for trend confirmation

Input:

Entry Price

Leverage (1x to 125x)

Position Size or Wallet Balance

✅ Liquidation Price

✅ Stop Loss (e.g., 2–3% below entry or ATR)

> Formula (Long example):



liq = entry * (1 - (1 / leverage))
sl = entry * 0.97
tp = entry * 1.05

🔹 8. 🔐 Safety & Bug-Free Design

All API calls are debounced (200–500ms)

Use async queue to avoid v18/v19 call errors:


let isProcessing = false;
async function safeRun(task) {
  if (isProcessing) return;
  isProcessing = true;
  await task();
  isProcessing = false;
}

Rate-limit Binance API calls to avoid IP bans

Auto-retry on timeout/fail (max 3x)
